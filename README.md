Overview

Timesian is a client-side project encompassing the following:

1. Performs a client side request to fetch the contents of a JSONP file.

2. Lays out the stories in a simple list with the information that should be displayed for each article. 

***Extra points for making a beautiful, "Timesian" presentation of the list.***

3. The page is responsive, with designs accommodating a 960+ web breakpoint, a 768 pixel tablet breakpoint, and a 320 pixel mobile breakpoint.

4.  Has the ability to toggle between English and a fake Martian language following these rules:
	- every word three characters or less is left alone
	- every word more than three characters is replaced with boinga.
	- maintain the same capitalization and punctuation in the English and Martian Versions.

***The conversion button is located at the bottom of the articles.***	

5. Uses git to track changes.

Happy Coding!!!
